## Glossary
- Isolated Monorepo - A repository that contains components that are completely isolated to the directory they are contained in (eg. JS frontend and Python backend)
- Shared Monorepo - A repository that contains components that share code or configuration from the root directory (eg. Yarn workspace or Lerna project)

## To Do
- Fix "utils" to be "@/utils" with jsconfig.json changes
- Fix layout
	- create `<main>` element in Layout.js with flexGrow: 1 to fill page
	- have child fill height 100%
	- check each features page
- Add theme.js - DARK MODE
- Add form library. /join should use a form library for validation
- Save form info in localStorage so users don't lose it if they change tabs
- Add favicon
- Save data into database (consider how to use it with Railway.app for deploying)
- Fix deployment to [railway.app](http://railway.app/)  	
- look into multi tenancy
